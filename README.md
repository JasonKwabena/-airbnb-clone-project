#Overview

This project is a clone of Airbnb, built to practice full-stack development skills. It includes key features like property listings, search functionality, user authentication, and booking management.

# Project Goals
- Build a responsive and visually appealing UI similar to Airbnb.
- Implement user authentication (sign-up, login, logout).
- Allow users to browse, search, and filter property listings.
- Enable property owners to create and manage listings.
- Integrate a booking system with date selection and payment processing.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js (or Next.js API routes)
- Database: MongoDB (or PostgreSQL)
- Authentication: NextAuth.js (or Firebase Auth)
- Payments: Stripe API
- Deployment: Vercel (for frontend) and Render/Heroku (for backend)

## Team Roles

In this project, team members will take on specialized roles to ensure efficient development and collaboration. Below are the key roles and their responsibilities:

### 1. Frontend Developer 
   - Responsibilities:  
     - Implement the UI using React.js/Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  
     - Ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.  
     - Integrate with backend APIs for data fetching (e.g., property listings, user auth).  
     - Optimize performance (e.g., lazy loading, client-side rendering).  

### 2. Backend Developer
   - Responsibilities:  
     - Design and develop the server-side logic using Node.js/Express.js or Next.js API routes.  
     - Create RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints for frontend communication.  
     - Handle authentication/authorization (e.g., JWT, OAuth).  
     - Integrate third-party services (e.g., Stripe for payments).  

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)  
   - Responsibilities:  
     - Design and manage the database schema (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).  
     - Optimize queries for performance and scalability.  
     - Ensure data security and backup strategies.  
     - Handle migrations and seeding for development/testing.  

### 4. DevOps Engineer 
   - Responsibilities:  
     - Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Vercel).  
     - Configure cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Render, Heroku).  
     - Monitor application performance and uptime.  
     - Manage environment variables and deployment scripts.  

### 5. QA/Testing Engineer 
   - Responsibilities:  
     - Write unit/integration tests (e.g., Jest, Cypress).  
     - Perform manual testing for edge cases and UI/UX feedback.  
     - Ensure bug fixes are validated before deployment.  

### 6. Product Manager (Optional) 
   - Responsibilities:  
     - Define project scope and prioritize features.  
     - Coordinate between team members and stakeholders.  
     - Track progress using tools like GitHub Projects or Trello.  


## Technology Stack  

This project leverages the following technologies, each chosen for their specific strengths in building a scalable, full-stack Airbnb clone:  

### Frontend  
- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), improving SEO and performance. Used to build dynamic pages (e.g., property listings, user dashboards).  
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly designing responsive UI components (e.g., modals, cards, navigation).  
- React (Context API/Redux): For state management (e.g., user authentication state, booking dates).  

### Backend
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side logic.  
- Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to create RESTful APIs (e.g., `/api/listings`, `/api/bookings`).  
- Next.js API Routes: An integrated backend solution (if using Vercel) to handle serverless functions.  

### Database  
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for flexible data storage (e.g., user profiles, property listings with unstructured fields like amenities).  
- PostgreSQL: An alternative relational database for structured data (e.g., bookings, payments) if complex queries are needed.  
- **Mongoose/Prisma: ORMs to simplify database interactions and enforce schemas.  

### APIs & Services
- GraphQL (Optional): An alternative to REST for efficient data fetching (e.g., fetching nested property-booking-user data in a single query).  
- Stripe API: Handles payment processing for bookings (e.g., credit card validation, refunds).  
- Google Maps API: Displays property locations and interactive maps.  

### Authentication 
- NextAuth.js: A library for implementing OAuth (e.g., "Sign in with Google") and JWT-based session management.  
- Firebase Auth (Optional): A ready-to-use authentication service with email/password and social logins.  

### DevOps & Deployment 
- Vercel: For frontend and serverless function deployment (built-in Next.js integration).  
- Docker: Containerization for consistent development/production environments.  
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

- # Database Design

This document outlines the key entities and their relationships for the property booking system.

## Entities

### Users
- Fields:  
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)  
  - `name`  
  - `email`  
  - `password_hash`  
  - `role` (e.g., guest, host, admin)  

- Relationships:  
  - A user can have multiple properties (if they are a host).  
  - A user can make multiple bookings (if they are a guest).  
  - A user can write multiple reviews.

# Feature Breakdown

## 1. User Management  
- Allows users to register, log in, and manage profiles.  
- Supports role-based access (guests, hosts, admins).  

## 2. Property Management  
- Hosts can list, edit, or delete properties with details like price and amenities.  
- Includes image uploads and search filters.  

[... include all other features from the previous breakdown ...]


# API Security

To ensure the integrity and safety of our platform, the following security measures will be implemented:

## 1. Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user login sessions.
- Password hashing (bcrypt) to protect credentials.
- Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and personal data.

## 2. Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions (e.g., only hosts can edit properties).
- Token validation for every API request.
- Why it matters: Ensures users can only perform actions permitted to their role (e.g., guests can’t delete properties).

## 3. Rate Limiting
- Throttling API requests (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP).
- Why it matters: Prevents brute-force attacks and DDoS attempts.

## 4. Data Encryption
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications.
- Why it matters**: Protects sensitive data (e.g., payments, personal info) during transit.

## 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (ORM/parameterized queries).
- Why it matters**: Blocks malicious code execution in databases.

## 6. Payment Security
- PCI-DSS compliance via Stripe/PayPal integration.
- Why it matters: Ensures financial data is never stored or mishandled.

# CI/CD Pipeline

## What is CI/CD? 
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates testing and deployment processes to ensure code changes are reliable and quickly delivered to production.  

## Why It Matters for This Project  
- Faster Releases: Automatically test and deploy updates.  
- Fewer Bugs: Catch issues early with automated testing.  
- Consistency: Reduce human error in deployments.  

## Tools We Use  
- GitHub Actions: For CI/CD workflows (test on every push).  
- Docker: Containerization for consistent environments.  
- AWS/Heroku: Cloud deployment targets.  
- SonarCloud: Code quality and security scanning.  

## Pipeline Stages 
1. Code Commit → 2. Automated Tests → 3. Build → 4. Deploy to Staging → 5. Production Release
